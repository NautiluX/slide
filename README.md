# slide

Simple, lightweight slideshow selecting random images from specified directory. This slideshow is designed to compile and run also on a Raspberry Pi, for example to turn it into a digital picture frame.

Tested versions: 
 * Raspberry Pi 3 running Raspbian Stretch.
 * Raspberry Pi 3 running Raspbian Buster.
 * Raspberry Pi Zero running Raspbian Buster.

Screen background is filled with a scaled version of the image to prevent pure black background.

## Usage

```
slide [-t rotation_seconds] [-T transition_seconds] [-c/--overlay-color overlay_color(#rrggbb)] [-a aspect] [-o background_opacity(0..255)] [-b blur_radius] -p image_folder [-r] [-O overlay_string] [-v]  [-s] [-S] [--verbose] [--stretch]
```

* `image_folder`: where to search for images (.jpg files)
* `-r` for recursive traversal of `image_folder`
* `-s` for shuffle instead of random image rotation
* `-S` for sorted rotation (files ordered by name, first images then subfolders)
* `rotation_seconds(default=30)`: time until next random image is chosen from the given folder
* `transition_seconds(default=1)`: time of image transition animation. Default is 1 second, and transition animation will be disabled if the value is set to 0
* `aspect(default=a)`: the required aspect ratio of the picture to display. Valid values are 'a' (all), 'l' (landscape) and 'p' (portrait)
* `background_opacity(default=150)`: opacity of the background filling image between 0 (black background) and 255
* `blur_radius(default=20)`: blur radius of the background filling image
* `-v` or `--verbose`: Verbose debug output when running, plus a thumbnail of the original image in the bottom left of the screen
* `--stretch`: When in aspect mode 'l' or 'p' crop the image rather than leaving a blurred background. For example, in landscape mode this will make images as wide as the screen and crop the top and bottom to fit.
* `-O` is used to create a overlay string.
  * It defines overlays for all four edges in the order `top-left;top-right;bottom-left;bottom-right`
  * All edges overlays are separated by `;`
  * Each edge can either be just a test or contain formatting in the form `margin|fontsize|text`
  * the text can contain special strings which are replaced during rendering:
    * `<time>` current time
    * `<date>` current date
    * `<datetime>` current time and date
    * `<exifdatetime>` time stamp from the EXIF data of the image
    * `<filename>` filename of the current image
    * `<basename>` basename of the current image (without suffix)
    * `<filepath>` filename including the path of the current image
    * `<dir>`directory of the current image
    * `<path>`path to the current image without filename
  * Example: `slide -p ./images -O "20|60|Time: <time>;;;Picture taken at <exifdatetime>"`
* `-c` or `--overlay-color` the color of the overlay text, in the form of 3 or 6 digits hex rgb string prefixed by `#`, for example `#00FF00` or `#0F0` for color ðŸŸ¢
To exit the application, press escape. If you're using a touch display, touch all 4 corners at the same time.

## Removing black border (Raspberry Pi)

```
if you find that you have a black border around your screen you can remove it by disabling overscan. This is done by editing /boot/config.txt and uncommenting disable_overscan=1 
```
